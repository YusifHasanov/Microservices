Microservices-based System for E-Commerce
This repository contains the source code for a microservices-based e-commerce system designed to facilitate user authentication, card management, payments, and product information retrieval. The system is composed of four key microservices: User, Card, Payment, and Product, each serving a specific purpose within the application.

System Overview
Microservices
User Service: Handles user registration, login, card management, and transaction history.
Card Service: Responsible for storing and managing card details.
Payment Service: Manages payment transactions and history.
Product Service: Stores product information and manages stock.
Technologies
Spring Boot: Framework for creating microservices.
Spring Security: Provides authentication and authorization.
Spring Cloud Eureka Server: Service discovery for managing microservices.
Spring Cloud Gateway: API Gateway for routing and filtering requests.
PostgreSQL: Database for persisting service data.
Spring Data JPA: Connects application with databases.
RabbitMQ: Handles data concurrency during payment processing.
Feign Client: Facilitates communication between services.
MapStruct: Maps between Java bean types.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
JDK 11 or later
Maven
Docker and Docker Compose (optional for containerization)
PostgreSQL
RabbitMQ
Installation
Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
For each microservice, navigate to its directory and build the application using Maven:

sh
Copy code
cd <microservice-directory>
mvn clean install
Set up the PostgreSQL databases for each service according to the configurations found in application.properties.

Run RabbitMQ instance:

If using Docker, you can run a RabbitMQ container:
sh
Copy code
docker run -d --hostname my-rabbit --name some-rabbit -p 8080:15672 -p 5672:5672 rabbitmq:3-management
Start each microservice. You can use the Spring Boot Maven plugin:

sh
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
Running with Docker Compose (Optional)
If you prefer to containerize your services, use Docker Compose to orchestrate the containers. Make sure you have a docker-compose.yml file set up with all the necessary services.

Run the following command:

sh
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
API Endpoints
The system exposes several REST endpoints for interaction:

User Registration: POST /user/register
User Login: POST /user/login
List Available Products: GET /product/list
Add Card for User: POST /card/add
List Added Cards of User: GET /card/list
Purchase Product: POST /payment/purchase
Retrieve Transaction History: GET /user/transactions
Architecture
This system adopts a microservices architecture, facilitating scalability, resilience, and modular development. Services communicate asynchronously where necessary, using RabbitMQ for handling payment operations to ensure data consistency and prevent race conditions.

Spring Cloud Eureka Server provides dynamic service discovery, allowing services to find and communicate with each other. Spring Cloud Gateway acts as the entry point for the system, routing requests to the appropriate microservices.
